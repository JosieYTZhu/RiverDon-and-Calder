Report for Data Science project

River Don is an English river mainly in South Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire, it derives from the Pennines and flows eastwardly through many major British cities, Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster for instance, and merges into the River Ouse eventually, and the total length of River Don is 70 miles (110km), around 1.3 million people are living along the rive.

*Caption: Figures 1 and 2 are the integrated hydrographs of River Don in Sheffield 2007 and 2019 flood events respectively. Figures 3 and 4 are integrated hydrographs of River Don in Rotherham 2007 and 2019 flood events respectively.*

*Caption: Figure 1 and 2 are hypothetical schemes for Rotherham in both 2007 and 2019 River Don flood events, Figure 3 reveals the flood mitigation schemes provided by Sheffield City Council; all of these three schemes could alleviate 100% of flood water.*
